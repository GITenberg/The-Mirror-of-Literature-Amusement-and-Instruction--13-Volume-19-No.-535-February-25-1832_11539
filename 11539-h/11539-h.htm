    <h2>GARDENS OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY.</h2>

    <h3>REGENT'S PARK.</h3>

    <p>A visit to these Gardens is one of the most delightful of
    the rational recreations of the metropolis. The walk out is
    pleasant enough: though there is little rural beauty on the
    road, the creations of art assume a more agreeable appearance
    than in the city itself; and, with cottages, park-like grounds,
    and flourishing wood, the eye may enjoy a few picturesque
    groupings.</p>

    <p>The <i>Garden</i> of the Society is one of the prettiest in
    the vicinity of the metropolis; the <i>Menagerie</i> is
    certainly the most important ever collected in this country. It
    is a charming sight to behold myriads of tiny flowers fringing
    our very paths, and little groves of shrubs and young trees
    around us; yet it is a gratification of the highest order, to
    witness the animals of almost every country on the earth
    assembled within a few acres; and it is indeed a sublime study
    to observe how beautifully the links in the great chain of
    nature are wrought, and how admirably are the habits and
    structure of some of these animals adapted to the wants of man,
    while all are subservient to some great purpose in the scale of
    creation. How clearly are these truths taught by the science of
    Zoology; and how attractively are they illustrated in the
    Menagerie of the Zoological Gardens. Consider but for a moment
    that the cat which crouches by our fireside is of the same
    tribe with "the lordly lion," whose roar is terrific as an
    earthquake, and the tiger who often stays but to suck the blood
    of his victims: that the faithful dog, "who knows us
    personally, watches for us, and warns us of danger," is but a
    descendant from the wolf, who prowls through the wintry waste
    with almost untameable ferocity. Yet how do we arrive at the
    knowledge of these interesting facts&mdash;but by zoological
    study.</p>

    <p>Two of the Cuts in the annexed page will furnish our country
    friends with the improved plan of keeping the animals in large
    open cages. The first represents that of the <i>Polar Bear</i>,
    of strong iron-work, with a dormitory adjoining. The enclosed
    area is flagged with stone, and in the centre is a tank, or
    pool, of water, in which the bear makes occasional plungings.
    The present occupant is but small in comparison with the usual
    size of the species. "Its favourite postures," observes Mr.
    Bennett, "are lying flat at its whole length; sitting upon its
    haunches with its fore legs perfectly upright, and its head in
    a dependent position; or standing upon all fours with its
    fore-paws widely extended and its head and neck swinging
    alternately from side to side, or upwards and downwards in one
    continued and equable libration."<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    <p>The second Cut represents the tunnelled communication
    between the two Gardens, beneath the carriage-road of the Park.
    Above, the archway is a pediment, supported by two neat
    columns, and a terraced walk, with balustrades. The whole is
    handsomely executed in cement or imitative stone. The
    decorative vases are by Austin, of the New Road. A lion's head,
    in bold relief, forms an appropriate key-stone embellishment to
    the arch. The sloping banks are formed of mimic rock-work
    profusely intermingled with plants and flowers.</p>

    <p>The third Cut is the Monkey House, of substantial iron-work,
    with dormitories and winter apartments in the rear. In fine
    sunny weather the monkeys may be here seen disporting their
    recreant limbs to the delight of crowds of visiters. Their
    species are too numerous but for a catalogue. Among them are
    the Negro and Sooty Monkeys,&mdash;the Mone Monkey: "the name
    of <i>Monkey</i> is supposed to be derived from the African
    appellation of this species, <i>Mone</i> corrupted into
    <i>Monachus</i>." Bonneted, pig-tailed, and Capuchin Monkeys;
    the last named from their dark crowns, like the capuch or hood
    of a Capuchin friar; and black and white-fronted Spider
    Monkeys, named from their great resemblance to large
    spiders.</p>

    <p>By the way, there is an abundance of still life in the
    Gardens at this ungenial season. We find the Elephant, the
    Antelopes, and the Zebra, in their winter quarters, and their
    mightinesses, the large cats, as the lions, tiger, and
    leopards, accommodated with a snug fire. The tropical birds, as
    the parrots, maccaws, &amp;c., have been removed from the
    extremity of the north garden to warmer quarters; and the
    hyaenas, leopards, and a host of smaller carnivorous quadrupeds
    have taken their places. The upper end is occupied by four
    roomy dens, with a lordly black-maned lion and a lioness, from
    Northern Africa; above them are a fine lioness and a leopard
    from Ceylon: these we take to have been among the recent
    arrivals from the Tower Menagerie.</p>

    <h2>FRAGMENTS ON HUMAN LIFE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Call not earth a barren spot,</p>

            <p>Pass it not ungrateful by,</p>

            <p>'Tis to man a lovely lot."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>There is no subject on which such a variety of opinions
    exist, as on the question "Whether man is happy;" and that it
    is not easy to be settled, is certain. Many persons have been
    so far contented with their lot as to wish to have their life
    over again, and yet as many have expressed themselves to the
    contrary.</p>

    <p>Dr. Johnson, who always spoke of human life in the most
    desponding terms, and considered earth a vale of tears,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Yet hope, not life from pain or sorrow free,</p>

            <p>Or think the doom of man reversed for
            thee&mdash;"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>declared that he would not live over again a single week of
    his life, had it been allowed him.<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> Such was his opinion on the past; but so great
    is the cheering influence with which Hope irradiates the mind,
    that in looking forward to the future, he always talked with
    pleasure on the prospect of a long life.</p>

    <p>When he was in Scotland, Boswell told him that after his
    death, he intended to erect a memorial to him. Johnson, to whom
    the very mention of death was unpleasant, replied, "Sir, I hope
    to see your grand-children." On his death-bed he observed to
    the surgeon who was attending him, "<i>I want life</i>, you are
    afraid of giving me pain."</p>

    <p>It has been supposed that this question had been settled by
    the authority of Scripture. "Man is born to trouble," says Job,
    "as the sparks fly upward." In turning over a few pages more,
    we find ourselves in doubt again. "<i>The latter end of Job was
    more blessed than his beginning</i>; for he had 14,000 sheep,
    and 6,000 camels, and 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 she-asses.
    He had also seven sons and three daughters. So Job died being
    old and full of days."</p>

    <p>It may not be unpleasant to place before the reader the
    opinions of several celebrated men, on Life, that he may choose
    his side, and either like the bee or the spider, extract the
    poison or gather the honey. We will begin with Sterne, one who
    well knew the human heart.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"What is the life of man? is it not to shift from side
        to side! from sorrow to sorrow!"</p>

        <p>"When I consider how oft we eat the bread of affliction,
        when one runs over the catalogue of all the cross
        reckonings and sorrowful items with which the heart of man
        is overcharged, 'tis wonderful by what hidden resources the
        mind is enabled to stand it out, and bear itself up, as it
        does, against the impositions laid upon our
        nature."&mdash;<i>T. Shandy</i>.</p>

        <p>"A man has but a bad bargain of it at the
        best."&mdash;<i>Chesterfield</i>.</p>

        <p>"No scene of human life but teems with mortal
        woe."&mdash;<i>Sir Walter Scott</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In opposition to these sentiments, Franklin, in writing on
    the death of a friend, gives us his opinion, "<i>It is a party
    of pleasure</i>, some take their seats first."</p>

    <p>And Lord Byron, describing Sunrise, in the second canto of
    <i>Lara</i>, says</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"But mighty nature bounds as from her birth,</p>

            <p>The sun is in the heavens, and life on earth;</p>

            <p>Flowers in the valley, splendour in the beam.</p>

            <p>Health on the gale, and freshness in the stream.</p>

            <p>Immortal Man! Behold her glories shine,</p>

            <p>And cry exultingly, 'They are thine'</p>

            <p>Gaze on, while yet thy gladdened eyes may see,</p>

            <p>A morrow comes when they are not for thee."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In the same spirit Cowper begins his poem on Hope:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"See Nature gay as when she first began,</p>

            <p>With smiles alluring her admirer, man,</p>

            <p>She spreads the morning over eastern hills.</p>

            <p>Earth glitters with the drops the night distils.</p>

            <p>The sun obedient at her call appears</p>

            <p>To fling his glories o'er the robe she wears,</p>

            <p class="i4">... to proclaim</p>

            <p>His happiness, her dear, her only aim."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"The Thracians," says Cicero, "wept when a child was born,
    and feasted and made merry when a man went out of the world,
    and with reason. Show me the man who knows what life is, and
    dreads death, and I'll show thee a prisoner who dreads his
    liberty."</p>

    <p>Of the misery of human life, Gray speaks in similar
    terms:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"To all their sufferings all are men,</p>

            <p>Condemn'd alike to groan,</p>

            <p>The feeling for another's pain,</p>

            <p>The unfeeling for his own."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Audi alteram partem:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"It's a happy world after all."&mdash;<i>Paley</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And Gray himself:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey,</p>

            <p class="i2">This careful, anxious being e'er
            resigned,</p>

            <p>E'er left the precincts of the <i>cheerful
            day</i></p>

            <p class="i2">Nor cast one longing, lingering look
            behind."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And another popular author:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"A world of pleasure is continually streaming in on
        every side. It only depends on man to be a demi-god, and to
        convert this world into Elysium."&mdash;<i>Gaieties and
        Gravities</i>.</p>
    </blockquote><span class="pagenum"><a id="page116"
       name="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>

    <p>It is doubtless wise to incline to the latter sentiment.</p>

    <p>Of the instability of human happiness and glory, a fine
    picture is drawn by Appian, who represents Scipio weeping over
    the destruction of Carthage. "When he saw this famous city,
    which had flourished seven hundred years, and might have been
    compared to the greatest empires, on account of the extent of
    its dominions, both by sea and land, its mighty armies, its
    fleets, elephants and riches; and that the Carthaginians were
    even superior to other nations, by their courage and greatness
    of soul, as, notwithstanding their being deprived of arms and
    ships, they had sustained for three whole years, all the
    hardships and calamities of a long siege; seeing, I say, this
    city entirely ruined, historians relate that he could not
    refuse his tears to the unhappy fate of Carthage. He reflected
    that cities, nations, and empires are liable to revolutions, no
    less than particular men; that the like sad fate had befallen
    Troy, once so powerful; and in later times, the Assyrians,
    Medes, and Persians, whose dominions were once of so great an
    extent; and lastly, the Macedonians, whose empire had been so
    glorious throughout the world." Full of these mournful ideas,
    he repeated the following verse of Homer:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"The day shall come, that great avenging day,</p>

            <p>Which Troy's proud glories in the dust shall
            lay,</p>

            <p>When Priam's powers, and Priam's self shall
            fall,</p>

            <p>And one prodigious ruin swallow all&mdash;"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>thereby denouncing the future destiny of Rome, as he himself
    confessed to Polybius, who desired Scipio to explain himself on
    that occasion.</p>

    <h3>A COASTING SCRAP.</h3>

    <h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>

    <p>It was a bright summer afternoon: the estuary of Poole
    Harbour lay extended before me; its broad expanse studded with
    inlands of sand and furze bushes, of which Brownsea is the most
    considerable. A slight ripple marked the deeper channels which
    were of a blue colour, and the shallow mud banks being but
    barely covered by the tide, appeared like sheets of molten
    silver. The blue hills of Purbeck bounded the distant
    heath-lands to the westward, and the harbour extended itself
    inland towards the town of Wareham, becoming more and more
    intricate in its navigation, although it receives the
    contributions of two rivers, the Piddle and the Froome, arising
    probably from the soil carried down by the streams, and the
    faint action of the tide at a distance of eight or ten miles
    from the mouth of the harbour. The Wareham clay boats added
    life to the scene. Some were wending their way through the
    intricate channels close hauled upon a wind; others were going
    right away with a flowing sheet. On the eastern side was the
    bold sweep of the shore, extending to the mouth of the harbour,
    and terminating in a narrow point of bright sand hills,
    separating the quiet waters of the harbour from the boisterous
    turmoilings of the English Channel.</p>

    <p>Sauntering along the Quay of Poole, indulging in a kind of
    reverie, thinking, or in fact, thinking of nothing at all, (a
    kind of waking dream, when hundreds of ideas, recollections,
    and feelings float with wonderful rapidity through the brain,)
    my attention was attracted by a stout, hardy-faced pilot, with
    water boots on his legs, and a red, woollen night-cap on his
    head, who was driving a very earnest bargain for a "small, but
    elegant assortment," of dabs and flounders. "Dree and zixpence
    if you like," said he. "I could a bought vour times as much vor
    one and zixpence coast-ways, if I'd a mind, and I'll give thee
    no more, and not a word of a lie." His oratory conquered the
    coyness of the fishy damsel; and he invited the lady to take a
    glass of "zomat avore he topped his boom for Swanwidge."</p>

    <p>Having before me the certainty of a dull, monotonous
    afternoon, and cheerless evening, without any visible means of
    amusement, I instantly closed a bargain with Dick Hart (for
    such was the pilot's name) to give me a cast to Swanwidge. In a
    short time I found myself on board a trim, little pilot boat,
    gliding along the waters as the sun was sliding his downward
    course, and shedding a mellow radiance over the distant scenery
    towards Lytchett. The white steeple of Poole church was lighted
    by the rays, while the town presented a neat and picturesque
    appearance with the masts of the shipping cutting against the
    blue sky.</p>

    <p>Dick Hart formed no small feature in the scene as he stood
    at the helm with his red cap and black, curly hair, smoking a
    short, clay pipe, which like his own face, had become rather
    brown in service. He looked around him with an air of
    independence and unconcern, as the "monarch of all he
    surveyed," casting his eye up now and then at the trim of his
    canvass, but more frequently keeping it on me. Dick began to
    open <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117"
       name="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span> his budget of chat, and I
       found him as full of fun as his mainsail was full of
       nettles.</p>

    <p>A voice from the forecastle called out to Dick, who was so
    intent on his story that the helm slipped from his hand, and
    the ship flew up in the wind, "Mind, skipper, or you will run
    down Old Betty." I was astonished at the insinuation against my
    noble captain that he was likely to behave rude to a lady, but
    my suspicions were soon removed, when I saw Old Betty was a
    buoy, floating on the waters, adorned with a furze bush. Old
    Betty danced merrily on the rippling wave with her furze bush
    by way of a feather, with shreds of dried sea weed hanging to
    it forming ribbons to complete the head dress of the lady buoy.
    The nearer we approached, the more rapid did Betty dance, and
    when we passed close alongside of her, she curtsied up and down
    as if to welcome our visit. Dick narrated why a buoy placed at
    the head of a mud bank obtained the name of a <i>lady fair</i>,
    and I briefly noted it down.</p>

    <p>Many years ago a single lady resided at Poole, of plain
    manners, unaffected simplicity, affable, yet retiring,
    and&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Passing rich with forty pounds a-year."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The gentry courted her, but she still adhered to her
    secluded habits. Year after year rolled on, and though some may
    have admired her, she was never led to the altar, and
    consequently her condition was <i>unaltered</i>. Kind and
    friendly neighbours kept a vigilant eye upon her proceedings,
    but her character was unimpeachable; and they all agreed that
    she was a very suspicious person, because they could not
    slander her. She lived a blameless single lady.</p>

    <p>Her attentions were directed to an orphan boy. He was her
    constant companion, and the object of her tenderest solicitude.
    As he grew up he excelled the youth of his own age in manly
    exercises; could thrash all of his own size, when insulted, but
    never played the tyrant, or the bully. He could make the
    longest innings at cricket, and as for swimming in all its
    various branches, none could compare with William. It was
    finally arranged by a merchant to send William a voyage to
    Newfoundland, and the news soon spread round the town that
    William (for he was a general favourite) was to <i>see</i> the
    world by taking to the <i>sea</i>.</p>

    <p>The time arrived when the ship was to be warped out from the
    Quay, and to sail for her destination. The crew and the
    passengers were all on board, and William was, by his absence,
    rather trespassing on the indulgence of the captain; but who
    could be angry with the boy whom every body loved?</p>

    <p>The town gossips, and many a fair maiden, were on the Quay
    to see young William embark. The tide had already turned, and
    the captain was about to give the word "to cast off and let all
    go;" to send the vessel, as it were, adrift, loose and
    unfettered upon the waters, to struggle as a thing of life with
    the billows of the Atlantic, but animated and controled by the
    energies of men. Just at this moment William appeared at the
    end of the Quay, walking slowly to the scene of embarkation
    with his kind and benevolent benefactress leaning, and leaning
    heavily, for her heart was heavy, upon the arm of her dutiful
    and beloved William. As they approached, the crowd made way
    with profound respect, not the cringing respect paid to
    superior wealth, but with that respect which worth of character
    and innate virtue can and will command, though poverty may
    smite and desolate.</p>

    <p>They walked unconscious of the notice they attracted. Their
    hearts were too full to heed the sympathies of others. The
    youth kept his eye fixed upon the loosening topsails of his
    ship; his benefactress grasped his arm almost convulsively, and
    looked, or rather stared, upon the ground. She dreaded the
    last, the hurried "fare well," the last look, the last word
    from her William, and she tottered as she approached the side
    of the ship. They stood locked hand in hand at the edge of the
    Quay; not a word was uttered by either; but they gazed at each
    other with a fondness which showed that their souls were in
    communion.</p>

    <p>"Now, William, jump on board&mdash;cast off there forward,"
    exclaimed the captain; "swing her head round&mdash;heave away
    my boys&mdash;come, William, come my boy."</p>

    <p>The youth awoke as from a startled sleep. He imprinted a
    kiss, the last kiss, upon the cold cheeks of his benefactress,
    and dashing away with the sleeve of his jacket a tear, of which
    he felt ashamed, in a moment he was on the quarter deck of his
    commander. He durst not look again upon the Quay; but had he
    looked he would have seen many a weeping maiden who had never
    told her love, and he would have seen his affectionate
    benefactress borne away in a fainting fit. All this he saw not,
    for he braced his courage up before his future messmates, and
    he looked forward <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118"
       name="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> to his duties,
       considering the past as but a dream.</p>

    <p>Months elapsed and tidings were frequently received of
    William. He had distinguished himself by his activity and
    docility. His townsmen heard with pleasure of his good conduct,
    and looked forward with satisfaction to welcome his return;
    when at length a pilot boat brought intelligence that the ship
    was lying at anchor at the mouth of the harbour, waiting the
    next tide with loss of foremast in a heavy gale the preceding
    night off the Bill of Portland. His benefactress, impatient of
    delay, immediately hired a boat, and preceded to the ship
    before the tide had turned; but she no sooner reached the deck
    than she was informed by the captain that William was aloft
    when the foremast went by the board on the preceding night, and
    that he fell into the raging waves without the possibility of
    relief being afforded him.</p>

    <p>"God's will be done," murmured the unhappy woman as she
    clasped her hands, and taking her station at the gangway, she
    continued gazing on the water as it rippled by, in a state of
    unconsciousness to every passing object. In the meantime the
    vessel was under weigh, and was coming once more in sight of
    Brownsea, when a plunge was heard&mdash;"she's overboard,"
    exclaimed a sailor&mdash;"cut away some spars&mdash;lower the
    boats&mdash;over with the hen coops&mdash;down with the helm,
    and back the topsails"&mdash;roared out many voices; but she
    had sunk to rise no more! Her corpse was found a few days after
    when the tide receded, lying on a mud bank, close to the buoy
    which has ever since been known by every sailor and every pilot
    of Poole under the name of Old Betty. But to complete the sad
    narrative, it appeared that William, as he excelled in
    swimming, succeeded in gaining the shore of Portland, and
    arrived in time at Poole to attend the remains of his
    benefactress to the grave in character of chief mourner.</p>

    <p>On opening her papers it was discovered that in losing his
    benefactress he had lost his mother! That she had been
    privately married to a widower of considerable fortune, who had
    one son by his first wife, and that on his demise the estate
    would devolve on William, provided his half brother had no
    children. A few days afterwards the death of Henry
    &mdash;&mdash;, Esq. of &mdash;&mdash; Hall, Worcestershire,
    was formally announced in the daily Journals, and the
    unexpected claims of William being acknowledged, he succeeded
    to a very fine property and estate, and died as much respected
    in a good old age as he was beloved in his buoyant childhood,
    when the gossips and the maidens of Poole agreed that the
    orphan boy promised to be a "nice young man."&mdash;"And not
    word of a lie in it," said Dick Hart, as he finished his story,
    his pipe, and his grog.</p>

    <p>We were now steering across Studland Bay. Banks of dark
    clouds were gathering majestically on the eastern horizon, and
    the sun was rapidly sinking in a flood of golden light. Behind
    us was the Isle of Brownsea, with its dark fir plantations and
    lofty, cold-looking, awkward castle. On the left was the line
    of low sand hills, stretching away towards Christchurch, and
    seeming to join the Needles' Rocks, situated at the western
    extremity of the Isle of Wight, the high chalk cliffs of which
    reflected the sun's last rays, giving a rich and placid feeling
    to the cold and distant grey. On the right, and closer to us,
    was the brown and purple heath-land of Studland Bay. Here
    barren, there patches of verdure, and the thin smoke threading
    its way from a cluster of trees, denoted where the village
    hamlet lay embosomed from the storms of the southwest gales,
    close at the foot and under the shelter of a lofty chalk range
    which abuts abruptly on the sea, and before which stands a
    high, detached pyramidical rock, rising out of the waters like
    a sheeted spectre, and known to mariners under the suspicious
    name of <i>Old Harry</i>.</p>

    <p>This coast was once notorious for smuggling, but those days
    of nautical chivalry have ceased, if Dick Hart is to be
    credited, who shook his head very mournfully as he alluded to
    "the <i>Block-head</i> service."</p>

    <h3>SCENE FROM A FRENCH DRAMA.</h3>

    <p>No. XVII. of the <i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i>, contains a
    paper of much interest to the playgoer as well as to the lover
    of dramatic literature&mdash;on two French dramas of great
    celebrity&mdash;<i>La Mar&eacute;chale d'Ancre</i>, by de
    Vigny; and <i>Marion Delorme</i>, by Victor Hugo. We quote a
    scene from the former. Concini, the principal character, is a
    favourite of Louis XIII.; the Mar&eacute;chale, his wife, has a
    first love, Borgia, a Corsican, who, disappointed in his early
    suit by the stratagems of Concini, has married the beautiful
    but uncultivated Isabella Monti. On the conflicting feelings of
    this strange personage, his
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119"
       name="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> hatred to the husband,
       and his relenting towards the wife; and the licentious plans
       of Concini for the seduction of Isabella, whom he has seen
       without knowing her to be the wife of his deadly enemy, the
       interest of the piece is made to turn. The jealous Isabella
       is at last persuaded that the Mar&eacute;chale has robbed
       her of the attachment of her husband, and appears as a
       witness against her on the pretended charge of witchcraft
       and sorcery.</p>

    <p>While the Mar&eacute;chal, even in the dungeon of the
    Bastile, is awing her oppressors into silence, bands of
    murderers are seeking Concini through the streets of Paris. As
    he issues from the house of the Jew which contains Isabella, he
    hears through the obscurity of the tempestuous night the cries
    of the populace, but he thinks they are but the indications of
    some passing tumult. He rests for a moment against a pillar on
    the pavement, but recoils again, as from a serpent, for he
    perceives it is the stone on which Ravaillac had planted his
    foot when he assassinated Henry, and in that murder it is
    darkly insinuated he had a share. Through the darkness of the
    Rue de la Ferronnerie, Michael Borgia is seen advancing,
    conducting the two children of his rival. He has promised to
    the Mar&eacute;chale to save them from the dangers of the
    night, and has brought them in safety to his own threshold. But
    his promise of safety extended not to Concini. The wild
    ferocity of the following scene has many parallels in the
    actual duels of the time, as delineated in Froissart and
    Brantome.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia (with the children.)</i>&mdash;Poor children! come
    in; you will be safer here than in the houses to which they
    have pursued us.</p>

    <p><i>The Boy</i>.&mdash;Ah! there is a man standing up.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia (turning the lantern which the child holds towards
    Concini.)</i>&mdash;Concini!</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;Borgia! (<i>Each raises his dagger,
    and seizes with the left arm the right of his enemy. They
    remain motionless, and gazing at each other. The children
    escape into the street and disappear</i>.)</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;Let go my arm, and I will liberate
    yours.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;What shall be my security?</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;Those children whom you have with
    you.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;I am labouring to save them. Your
    palace is on fire&mdash;your wife is arrested&mdash;your
    fortune is wrecked&mdash;base, senseless adventurer!</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;Have done&mdash;let go&mdash;let us
    fight!</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i> (<i>pushing him from him</i>.)&mdash;Back,
    then, and draw your sword.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i> (<i>draws</i>.)&mdash;Begin.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;Remove those children&mdash;they would
    be in our way.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;They are gone.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;Take these letters, assassin! I had
    promised to restore them to you. (<i>He hands to Concini a
    black portfolio</i>.)</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;I would have taken them from your
    body.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;I have performed my promise&mdash;and
    now, ravisher! look to yourself.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;Base seducer, defend
    <i>thyself</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;The night is dark, but I shall feel you
    by my hate: Plant your foot against the wall, that you may not
    retreat.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;Would I could chain yours to the
    pavement, that I might be sure of my mark!</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;Agree that the first who is wounded
    shall inform the other.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;Yes, for we should not see the blood.
    I swear it by the thirst I feel for yours.&mdash;But not that
    the affair should end there.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;No, only to begin again with more
    spirit.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>&mdash;To continue till we can lift the sword
    no longer.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;Till the death of one or other of
    us.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>&mdash;I see you not. Are you in front of
    me?</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;Yes, wretch! Parry that thrust. Has it
    sped?</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;No; take that in return.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;I am untouched.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;What, still? Oh! would I could but see
    thy hateful visage. (<i>They continue to fight desperately, but
    without touching each other. Both rest for a little</i>.)</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;Have you a cuirass on, Concini?</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;I had, but I left it with your wife in
    her chamber.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;Liar! (<i>He rushes on him with his
    sword. Their blades are locked for a moment, and both are
    wounded</i>.)</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;I feel no sword opposed to mine. Have
    I wounded you?</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>, (<i>leaning on his sword, and staunching the
    wound in his breast with, his handkerchief</i>.) No, let us
    begin again. There!</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i> (<i>binding his scarf round his
    thigh</i>.)&mdash;One moment and I am with you. (<i>He staggers
    against the
    pillar</i>.)</p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page120"
       name="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>, (<i>sinking on his knees</i>.)&mdash;Are you
    not wounded yourself?</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;No, no! I am resting. Advance, and you
    shall see.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i> (<i>endeavouring to rise, but
    unable</i>.)&mdash;I have struck my foot against a
    stone&mdash;wait an instant.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i> (<i>with delight</i>.)&mdash;Ah! you are
    wounded!</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;No, I tell you&mdash;'tis you who are
    so. Your voice is changed.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>, (<i>feeling his sword</i>.)&mdash;My blade
    smells of blood.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;Mine is dabbled in it.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;Come then, if you are not *&mdash;come
    and finish me.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>, (<i>with triumph</i>.)&mdash;Finish! then you
    are wounded.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>, (<i>with a voice of despair</i>.)&mdash;Were
    I not, would I not have already stabbed you twenty times over?
    But you are at least as severely handled.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>&mdash;It maybe so, or I should not be
    grovelling here.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;Shall we now have done?</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>, (<i>enraged</i>.)&mdash;Both
    wounded&mdash;yet both living!</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>.&mdash;What avails the blood I have drawn,
    while a drop remains.</p>

    <p><i>Borgia</i>.&mdash;O! were I but beside thee! <i>Enter</i>
    Vitry, <i>followed by the Guards walking slowly. He holds the
    young</i> Count de la Pene <i>by the hand; the boy leads his
    sister</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Vitry</i>, (<i>a pistol in his hand</i>.)&mdash;Well, my
    child, which is your father?</p>

    <p><i>Count de la Pene</i>.&mdash;Oh! protect him,
    sir,&mdash;that is he leaning against the pillar.</p>

    <p><i>Vitry</i>, (<i>aloud</i>.)&mdash;Draw tip&mdash;remain at
    that gate&mdash;Guards! (<i>The Guards advance with lanterns
    and flambeaux</i>.) Sir, I arrest you&mdash;your sword.</p>

    <p><i>Concini</i>, (<i>thrusting at him</i>.)&mdash;Take it.
    (Vitry <i>fires his pistol</i>&mdash;Du Hallier, D'Ornano,
    <i>and</i> Person <i>fire at the same time</i>&mdash;Concini
    <i>falls dead</i>.)</p>

    <p>The malice of Du Luynes, the inveterate enemy of the
    D'Ancres, and afterwards the minion of Louis, contrives that
    the Mar&eacute;chale, in her way to execution, shall be
    conducted to this scene, where her husband lies dead, on the
    spot which had been stained with the blood of Henry, like
    Caesar at the foot of Pompey's statue; and the play concludes
    with her indignant and animated denunciation of this wretch,
    who stands calm and triumphant, while the Mar&eacute;chale
    exacts from her son, over the body of Concini, an oath of
    vengeance against the destroyer of her house.</p>

    <h3>THE ITALIAN REPUBLICS.</h3>

    <p>M.J.C.L. De Sismondi, has, to suit the plan of the
    <i>Cabinet Cyclopaedia</i>, endeavoured to include in one of
    its volumes&mdash;a summary of Italian history from the fall of
    the Roman empire to the end of the Middle Age&mdash;a period of
    about six and a half centuries. What a succession of stirring
    scenes does this volume present; what fields of bloody action;
    what revelry of carnage; what schemes of petty ambition; what
    trampling on necks, what uncrowning of heads; what orgies of
    fire, sword, famine, and slaughter; what overtoppling of
    thrones, and unseating of rulers; what pantings after freedom;
    what slavery of passion; what sunny scenes of fortune to be
    shaded with melancholy pictures of desolation and
    decay&mdash;are comprised in these few pages of the history of
    a comparatively small portion of the world for a short
    period&mdash;a narrow segment of the cycle of time. What
    Sismondi so ably accomplished in sixteen volumes, he has here
    comprised in one. He tells us that he could sacrifice episodes
    and details without regret. The present is not, however, an
    abridgment of his great work, "but an entirely new history, in
    which, with my eyes fixed solely on the free people of the
    several Italian states, I have studied to portray their first
    deliverance, their heroism, and their misfortunes."</p>

    <p>We quote a few sketchy extracts.</p>

    <h3><i>Last Struggle of Rome for Liberty</i>.</h3>

    <p>"1453. Stefano Porcari, a Roman noble, willing to profit by
    the interregnum which preceded the nomination of Nicholas V.,
    to make the Roman citizens demand the renewal and confirmation
    of their ancient rights and privileges, was denounced to the
    new pope as a dangerous person; and, so far from obtaining what
    he had hoped, he had the grief to see the citizens always more
    strictly excluded from any participation in public affairs.
    Those were entrusted only to prelates, who, being prepared for
    it neither by their studies nor sentiments, suffered the
    administration to fall into the most shameful disorder.</p>

    <p>"In an insurrection of the people in the Piazza Navona,
    arising from a quarrel, which began at a bull-fight, Stefano
    Porcari endeavoured to direct their attention to a more noble
    object, and turn this tumult to the advantage of liberty. The
    pope hastily indulged all the fancies of the people, with
    respect to their games or amusements; but firmly rejected all
    their serious demands, and exiled Porcari to Bologna. The
    latter hoped to obtain by conspiracy what he had failed to
    accomplish by insurrection. There were not less than 400 exiled
    Roman citizens: he persuaded them all to join him, and
    appointed them a rendezvous at Rome, for the 5th of January,
    1453, in the house of his brother-in-law. Having escaped the
    vigilance of the legate of Bologna, he proceeded there himself,
    accompanied by 300 soldiers, whom he had enlisted in his
    service. The whole band was assembled on the night of the
    appointed 5th of January; and Stefano Porcari was haranguing
    them, to prepare them for the attack of the capitol,&mdash;in
    which he reckoned on re-establishing the senate of the Roman
    republic,&mdash;when, his secret having been betrayed, the
    house was surrounded with troops, the doors suddenly forced,
    and the conspirators overcome by numbers before their arms had
    been distributed. Next morning, the body of Stefano Porcari,
    with those of nine of his associates, were seen hanging from
    the battlements of the castle of St. Angelo. In spite of their
    ardent entreaties, they had been denied confession and the
    sacrament. Eight days later, the executions, after a mockery of
    law proceedings, were renewed, and continued in great numbers.
    The pope succeeded in causing those who had taken refuge in
    neighbouring states to be delivered up to him; and thus the
    last spark of Roman liberty was extinguished in blood."</p>

    <h3><i>General Mildness of Italian Warfare</i>.</h3>

    <p>"1492. The horses and armour of the Italian men at arms were
    reckoned superior to those of the transalpine nations against
    which they had measured themselves in France, during "the war
    of the public weal." The Italian captains had made war a
    science, every branch of which they thoroughly knew. It was
    never suspected for a moment that the soldier should be wanting
    in courage: but the general mildness of manners, and the
    progress of civilization, had accustomed the Italians to make
    war with sentiments of honour and humanity towards the
    vanquished. Ever ready to give quarter, they did not strike a
    fallen enemy. Often, after having taken from him his horse and
    armour, they set him free; at least, they never demanded a
    ransom so enormous as to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122"
       name="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span> ruin him. Horsemen who
       went to battle clad in steel, were rarely killed or wounded,
       so long as they kept their saddles. Once unhorsed, they
       surrendered. The battle, therefore, never became murderous.
       The courage of the Italian soldiers, which had accommodated
       itself to this milder warfare, suddenly gave way before the
       new dangers and ferocity of barbarian enemies. They became
       terror-struck when they perceived that the French caused
       dismounted horsemen to be put to death by their valets, or
       made prisoners only to extort from them, under the name of
       ransom, all they possessed. The Italian cavalry, equal in
       courage, and superior in military science, to the French,
       was for some time unable to make head against an enemy whose
       ferocity disturbed their imaginations."</p>

    <h3><i>Battle of Marignano</i>.</h3>

    <p>"1515.&mdash;Francis I. succeeded Louis XII. on the 1st of
    January; on the 27th of June he renewed his predecessor's
    treaty of alliance with Venice; and on the 15th of August,
    entered the plains of Lombardy, by the marquisate of Saluzzo,
    with a powerful army. He met but little resistance in the
    provinces south of the Po, but the Swiss meanwhile arrived in
    great force to defend Maximilian Sforza, whom, since they had
    reseated him on the throne, they regarded as their vassal.
    Francis in vain endeavoured to negotiate with them; they would
    not listen to the voice of their commanders; democracy had
    passed from their <i>landsgemeinde</i> into their armies,
    popular orators roused their passions; and on the 13th of
    September they impetuously left Milan to attack Francis I. at
    Marignano. Deep ditches lined with soldiers bordered the
    causeway by which they advanced; their commanders wished by
    some manoeuvre to get clear of them, or make the enemy change
    his position; but the Swiss, despising all the arts of war,
    expected to command success by mere intrepidity and bodily
    strength. They marched to the battery in full front; they
    repulsed the charge of the knights with their halberds, and
    threw themselves with fury into the ditches which barred their
    road. Some rushed on to the very mouths of the cannon, which
    guarded the king, and there fell. Night closed on the
    combatants; and the two armies mingled together fought on for
    four hours longer by moonlight. Complete darkness at length
    forced them to rest on their arms; but the king's trumpet
    continually sounded, to indicate to the bivouac where he was to
    be found; while the two famous horns of Uri and Unterwalden
    called the Swiss together. The battle was renewed on the 14th
    at daybreak: the unrelenting obstinacy was the same; but the
    French had taken advantage of the night to collect and fortify
    themselves. Marshal Trivulzio, who had been present at eighteen
    pitched battles, declared that every other seemed to him
    children's play in comparison with this "battle of giants," as
    he called it: 20,000 dead already covered the ground; of these
    two-thirds were Swiss. When the Swiss despaired of victory they
    retreated slowly,&mdash;but menacing and terrible. The French
    did not dare to pursue them."</p>

    <p>The concluding paragraph of the volume is beautifully
    enthusiastic: it may almost be regarded as prophetic in
    connexion with events that are at this moment shaking Italy to
    her very base:</p>

    <p>"Italy is crushed; but her heart still beats with the love
    of liberty, virtue, and glory: she is chained and covered with
    blood; but she still knows her strength and her future destiny:
    she is insulted by those for whom she has opened the way to
    every improvement; but she feels that she is formed to take the
    lead again: and Europe will know no repose till the nation
    which, in the dark ages, lighted the torch of civilization with
    that of liberty, shall be enabled herself to enjoy the light
    which she created."</p>

    <h3>CHILD'S ARITHMETICAL TABLES.</h3>

    <p>The Seventh Edition, besides being well adapted for Schools,
    will be found useful in the business of life. It includes the
    monies, weights, and measures, mentioned in Scripture, the
    length of miles in different countries, astronomical signs, and
    other matters computed with great care.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>THE GEORGIAN ERA.</h3>

    <p>This work is intended to comprise Memoirs of the most
    eminent characters who have flourished in Great Britain during
    the reigns of the four Georges: the present volume being only a
    fourth of its extent, and containing the Royal Family, the
    Pretenders and their adherents, churchmen, dissenters, and
    statesmen. The importance of the chosen period is prefatorily
    urged by the editor: "In comparison with the Elizabethan or the
    Modern Augustan, (as the reign of Anne has been designated,
    that which may be appropriately termed the Georgian Era,
    possesses a paramount <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123"
       name="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span> claim to notice; for not
       only has it been equally fertile in conspicuous characters,
       and more prolific of great events, but its influence is
       actually felt by the existing community of Great
       Britain."</p>

    <p>The several memoirs, so far as a cursory glance enables us
    to judge, are edited with great care. Their uniformity of plan
    is very superior to hastily compiled biographies. Each memoir
    contains the life and labours of its subject, in the smallest
    space consistent with perspicuity; the dryness of names, dates,
    and plain facts being admirably relieved by characteristic
    anecdotes of the party, and a brief but judicious summary of
    character by the editor. In the latter consists the original
    value of the work. The reader need not, however, take this
    summary "for granted:" he is in possession of the main facts
    from which the editor has drawn his estimate, and he may, in
    like manner, "weigh and consider," and draw his own inference.
    The anecdotes, to borrow a phrase from Addison, are the
    "sweetmeats" of the book, but the caution with which they are
    admitted, adds to their worth. The running reader may say that
    much of this portion is not entirely new to him: granted; but
    it would be unwise to reject an anecdote for its popularity; as
    Addison thought of "Chevy Chase," its commonness is its worth.
    But, it should be added, that such anecdotes are not told in
    the circumlocutory style of gossip, nor nipt in the bud by
    undeveloped brevity. We have Selden's pennyworth of spirit
    without the glass of water: the quintessence of condensation,
    which, we are told, is the result of time and experience, which
    rejects what is no longer essential. Here circumspection was
    necessary, and it has been well exercised. The anecdotes are
    not merely amusing but useful, since only when placed in
    juxtaposition with a man's whole life, can such records be of
    service in appreciating his character.</p>

    <p>Let us turn to the volume for a few examples, and take
    George the Fourth and Sheridan, for their contemporary
    interest; though the earlier characters are equally attractive.
    In the former the reader may better compare the editor's
    inference with his own impression.</p>

    <h3><i>George the Fourth</i>.</h3>

    <p>"Endowed by nature with remarkably handsome features, and a
    form so finely proportioned, that at one period of his life it
    was deemed almost the best model of manly beauty in existence,
    George the Fourth, during the early part of his manhood,
    eclipsed the whole of his gay associates in fashion and
    gallantry, as much by personal attractions, as pre-eminence in
    birth. Byron describes him as having possessed "fascination in
    his very bow;" and it is said, that a young peeress, on hearing
    of the prince's attentions to one of her fair friends,
    exclaimed, "I sincerely hope that it may not be my turn next,
    for to repel him is impossible." Towards the middle period of
    his life, he became so enormously fat, that four life-guardsmen
    could not, without difficulty, lift him on horseback; but, as
    he advanced in years, although still corpulent, his
    inconvenient obesity gradually diminished.</p>

    <p>"He scarcely ever forgot an injury, an affront, or a marked
    opposition to his personal wishes. The cordiality which had
    previously subsisted between his majesty and Prince Leopold,
    entirely ceased, when the latter volunteered a visit to Queen
    Caroline on her return to this country, in 1820: Brougham and
    Dentrum, for the zeal with which they had advocated the cause
    of their royal client, were, during a long period, deemed
    unworthy of those legal honours to which their high talents and
    long standing at the bar, justly entitled them: and Sir Robert
    Wilson was arbitrarily dismissed from the service, for his
    interference at her majesty's funeral. On account of his
    unpopular reception, by the mob, when he accompanied the allied
    sovereigns to Guildhall, in 1814, he never afterwards honoured
    the city with his presence; and when Rossini rudely declined
    the repetition of a piece of music, in which the king had taken
    a conspicuous part, at a court concert, his majesty turned his
    back on the composer, to whose works, from that moment, he
    displayed the most unequivocal dislike. But, on the other hand,
    some cases have been recorded, in which his conduct was
    unquestionably tolerant and forgiving. He allowed Canning, an
    avowed supporter of the queen, to retain office, without taking
    any part in the ministerial proceedings against her majesty;
    and at the last stage of his earthly career, sent the Duke of
    Sussex, with whom he had long been at variance, his own ribbon
    of the order of St. Patrick, with an assurance of his most
    sincere affection. Erskine, while attorney-general to the
    prince, had so offended his royal highness, by accepting a
    retainer from Paine, on a prosecution being instituted against
    the latter for publishing the Rights of Man, that his immediate
    resignation was required. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page124"
       name="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span> But, sometime afterwards,
       Erskine was desired to attend at Carlton house, where the
       prince received him with great cordiality, and, after
       avowing his conviction that, 'in the instance that had
       separated them, his learned and eloquent friend had acted
       from the purest motives, he wished to give publicity to his
       present opinion on the subject, by appointing Mr. Erskine
       his chancellor.' On one occasion, at the opening of a
       session of parliament by George the Third in person, his
       royal highness, who was then very much in debt, having gone
       down to the house of lords in a superb military uniform with
       diamond epaulettes, Major Doyle subsequently remarked to
       him, that his equipage had been much noticed by the mob.
       'One fellow,' added the major, 'prodigiously admired, what
       he termed 'the fine things which the prince had upon his
       shoulders.' 'Mighty fine, indeed,' replied another; 'but,
       mind me, they'll soon be <i>upon our shoulders</i>, for all
       that.' 'Ah, you rogue!' exclaimed the prince, laughing,
       'that's a hit of your own, I am convinced:&mdash;but, come,
       take some wine.'</p>

    <p>"He had some inclination for scientific pursuits, and highly
    respected those who were eminent for mechanical inventions. He
    contributed largely towards the erection of a monument to the
    memory of Watt. Of his medical information, slight as it
    undoubtedly was, he is said to have been particularly proud.
    Carpue had demonstrated to him the general anatomy of the human
    body, in his younger days; and for a number of years, the
    ingenious Weiss submitted to his inspection all the new
    surgical instruments, in one of which the king suggested some
    valuable improvements.</p>

    <p>"His talents were, undoubtedly, above the level of
    mediocrity: they have, however, been greatly overrated, on the
    supposition that several powerfully written documents, put
    forth under his name, but composed by some of his more
    highly-gifted friends, were his own productions. His style was,
    in fact, much beneath his station: it was inelegant, destitute
    of force, and even occasionally incorrect. He read his speeches
    well, but not excellently: he possessed no eloquence, although,
    as a convivial orator, he is said to have been rather
    successful.</p>

    <p>"At one time, while an associate of Sheridan, Erskine, Fox,
    &amp;c., he affected, in conversation, to be brilliant, and so
    far succeeded, as to colloquial liveliness, that during their
    festive intercourse, according to the witty barrister's own
    admission, 'he fairly kept up at saddle-skirts' even with
    Curran. Notwithstanding this compliment, his pretensions to wit
    appear to have been but slender; the best sayings attributed to
    him being a set of middling puns, of which the following is a
    favourable selection:&mdash;When Langdale's distillery was
    plundered, during the riots of 1780, he asked why the
    proprietor had not defended his property. 'He did not possess
    the means to do so,' was the reply. 'Not the means of defence!'
    exclaimed the prince, 'and he a brewer&mdash;a man who has been
    all his life at <i>cart</i> and <i>tierce</i>!&mdash;Sheridan
    having told him that Fox had <i>cooed</i> in vain to Miss
    Pulteney, the prince replied, 'that his friend's attempt on the
    lady's heart was a <i>coup maoqu&egrave;</i>.'&mdash;He once
    quoted from Suetonius, the words, '<i>Jure</i> caesus videtur,'
    to prove, jestingly, that trial by jury was as old as the time
    of the first Caesar.&mdash;A newspaper panegyric on Fox,
    apparently from the pen of Dr. Parr, having been presented to
    his royal highness, he said that it reminded him of Machiavel's
    epitaph, 'Tanto nomini nullum <i>Par</i> eulogium.'&mdash;A
    cavalry officer, at a court ball, hammered the floor with his
    heels so loudly, that the prince observed, 'If the war between
    the mother country and her colonies had not terminated, he
    might have been sent to America as a republication of the
    <i>stamp</i> act.'&mdash;While his regiment was in daily
    expectation of receiving orders for Ireland, some one told him,
    that country quarters in the sister kingdom were so filthy,
    that the rich uniforms of his corps would soon be lamentably
    soiled: 'Let the men act as dragoons, then,' said his royal
    highness, 'and <i>scour the country</i>.' When Horne Tooke, on
    being committed to prison for treason, proposed, while in jail,
    to give a series of dinners to his friends, the prince
    remarked, that 'as an inmate of Newgate, he would act more
    consistently by establishing a
    <i>Ketch</i>-club.'&mdash;Michael Kelly having turned
    wine-merchant, the prince rather facetiously said, 'that Mick
    <i>imported</i> his music, and <i>composed</i> his wine!'"</p>

    <p>We reluctantly break off here till next week.</p>

    <h3>BRIGHTON AS IT WAS.</h3>

    <h4><i>(Concluded from page 90.)</i></h4>

    <p>This immunity, however, deprived them of the privileges
    which the people of the adjacent towns enjoyed; and was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125"
       name="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span> probably the true reason,
       why this town did not obtain a place among those called
       Cinque ports. It lies in their neighbourhood, is more
       ancient, and was always more considerable than most included
       in that number.</p>

    <p>To reduce its consequence still more, the tithes were in
    this period taken from the incumbent, appropriated to the use
    of the Priory at Lewes, and have never since been restored; and
    a Convent of mendicant friars, more burthensome than ten
    endowed ones of monks, was founded and dedicated to St.
    Bartholomew.</p>

    <p>Struggling under these difficulties, nothing but the
    Reformation could enable the inhabitants of this place to
    emerge from their wretchedness. And accordingly we find, that,
    in the happier days of Queen Elizabeth, their affairs put on a
    new face. They then applied themselves with vigour to their old
    employments of fishing, and fitting out vessels for trade;
    seeking subsistence from their darling element the sea.</p>

    <p>Persecution prevailing at this juncture in many parts of
    Europe, numbers fled to this island as to an asylum, and many
    settled in this town, bringing with them industry, and an
    attachment to maritime affairs; or soon learning them here. The
    number of its inhabitants being thus increased, its trade
    became proportionably greater: so that in 1579, a record now
    subsisting says, "There are in the said town of Brighthelmston
    of fishing-boats four-score in number, and of able mariners
    four hundred in number, with ten thousand fishing-nets, besides
    many other necessaries belonging to their
    mystery."<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> And the descendants of many of these French,
    Dutch, and Spanish families still reside
    here.<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

    <p>From this record we likewise learn, that the town was
    fortified to the sea by a flint wall, and that the fort, called
    the Block-house, had been then lately erected. The east-gate of
    this wall, in a line with the Block-house was actually standing
    last year, and has been since taken down to open a more
    convenient entrance to a battery lately
    built.<a id="footnotetag5"
       name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

    <p>The town at present consists of six principal streets, many
    lanes, and some spaces surrounded with houses, called by the
    inhabitants squares. The great plenty of flint stones on the
    shore, and in the corn-fields near the town, enabled them to
    build the walls of their houses with that material, when in
    their most impoverished state; and their present method of
    ornamenting the windows and doors with the admirable brick
    which they burn for their own use, has a very pleasing effect.
    The town improves daily, as the inhabitants, encouraged by the
    late great resort of company, seem disposed to expend the whole
    of what they acquire in the erecting of new buildings, or
    making the old ones convenient. And should the increase of
    these, in the next seven years, be equal to what it has been in
    the last, it is probable there will be but few towns in
    England, that will excel this in commodious
    buildings.<a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

    <p>Here are two public rooms, the one convenient, the other not
    only so, but elegant; not excelled perhaps by any public room
    in England, that of York excepted: and the attention of the
    proprietor in preparing every thing that may answer for the
    conveniency and amusement of the company, is extremely
    meritorious.</p>

    <p>For divine service there is a large Church, pleasantly
    situated on a rising ground above the town; but at a distance
    that is inconvenient to the old and infirm. The Dissenters,
    who, of all denominations, amount to but forty families, have a
    Presbyterian, a Quaker's, and an Anabaptist's
    meeting-house.</p>

    <p>The men of this town are busied almost the whole year in a
    succeeding variety of fishing; and the women industriously
    dedicate part of their time, disengaged from domestic cares, to
    the providing of nets adapted to the various employments of
    their husbands.</p>

    <p>The spring season is spent in dredging for oysters, which
    are mostly bedded in the Thames and Medway, and afterwards
    carried to the London market; the mackerel fishery employs them
    during the months of May, June, and July; and the fruits of
    their labour are always sent to London; as Brighthelmston has
    the advantage of being its
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126"
       name="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> nearest fishing
       sea-coast, and as the consumption of the place, and its
       environs, is very inconsiderable. In the early part of this
       fishery they frequently take the red mullet; and near the
       close of it, abundance of lobsters and prawns. August is
       engaged in the trawl-fishery, when all sorts of flat fish
       are taken in a net called by that name. In September they
       fish for whiting with lines; and in November the herring
       fishery takes place, which is the most considerable and
       growing fishery of the whole. Those employed in this pursuit
       show an activity and boldness almost incredible, often
       venturing out to sea in their little boats in such weather
       as the largest ships can scarce live in. Part of their
       acquisition in this way is sent to London, but the greatest
       share of it is either pickled, or dried and made red. These
       are mostly sent to foreign markets, making this fishery a
       national concern.<a id="footnotetag7"

    <p>In examining the ancient and modern descriptions of the
    Baiae in Campania, where the Romans of wealth and quality,
    during the greatness of that empire, retired for the sake of
    health and pleasure, when public exigencies did not require
    their attendance at Rome, and comparing them with those of
    Brighthelmston, I can perceive a striking resemblance; and I am
    persuaded, that every literary person who will impartially
    consider this matter on the spot, will concur with me in
    opinion, giving, in some measure, the preference to our own
    Baiae, as exempt from the inconvenient steams of hot
    sulphureous baths, and the dangerous vicinity of Mount
    Vesuvius. And I have no doubt but it will be equally
    frequented, when the healthful advantages of its situation
    shall be sufficiently made known.</p>

    <h3>A NIGHT ON THE NIGER.</h3>

    <h4><i>(From the Landers' Travels; unpublished.)</i></h4>

    <p>We made no stop whatever on the river, not even at
    meal-times, our men suffering the canoe to glide down with the
    stream while they were eating their food. At five in the
    afternoon they all complained of fatigue, and we looked around
    us for a landing-place, where we might rest awhile, but we
    could find none, for every village which we saw after that hour
    was unfortunately situated behind large thick morasses and
    sloughy bogs, through which, after various provoking and
    tedious trials, we found it impossible to penetrate. We were
    employed three hours in the afternoon in endeavouring to find a
    landing at some village, and though we saw them distinctly
    enough from the water, we could not find a passage through the
    morasses, behind which they lay. Therefore we were compelled to
    relinquish the attempt, and continue our course on the Niger.
    We passed several beautiful islands in the course of the day,
    all cultivated and inhabited, but low and flat. The width of
    the river appeared to vary considerably, sometimes it seemed to
    be two or three miles across, and at others double that width.
    The current drifted us along very rapidly, and we guessed it to
    be running at the rate of three or four miles an hour. The
    direction of the stream continued nearly east. The day had been
    excessively warm, and the sun set in beauty and grandeur,
    shooting forth rays tinged with the most heavenly hues, which
    extended to the zenith. Nevertheless, the appearance of the
    firmament, all glorious as it was, betokened a coming storm;
    the wind whistled through the tall rushes, and darkness soon
    covered the earth like a veil. This rendered us more anxious
    than ever to land somewhere, we cared not where, and to
    endeavour to procure shelter for the night, if not in a
    village, at least under a tree. Accordingly, rallying the
    drooping spirits of our men, we encouraged them to renew their
    exertions by setting them the example, and our canoe darted
    silently and swiftly down the current. We were enabled to steer
    her rightly by the vividness of the lightning, which flashed
    across the water continually, and by this means also we could
    distinguish any danger before us, and avoid the numerous small
    islands with which the river is interspersed, and which
    otherwise might have embarrassed us very seriously. But though
    we could perceive almost close to us several lamps burning in
    comfortable-looking huts, and could plainly distinguish the
    voices of their occupants, and though we exerted all our
    strength to get at them, we were foiled in every attempt, by
    reason of the sloughs and fens, and we were at last obliged to
    abandon them in despair. Some of these lights, after leading us
    a long way, eluded our search, and vanished from our sight like
    an <i>ignis fatuus</i>, and others danced about we knew not
    how. But what was more vexatious than all, after we had got
    into an inlet, and toiled and tugged for a full half hour
    against the current, which in this little
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127"
       name="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span> channel was uncommonly
       rapid, to approach a village from which we thought it
       flowed, both village and lights seemed to sink into the
       earth, the sound of the people's voices ceased of a sudden,
       and when we fancied we were actually close to the spot, we
       strained our eyes in vain to see a single hut,&mdash;all was
       gloomy, dismal, cheerless, and solitary. It seemed the work
       of enchantment; every thing was as visionary as "sceptres
       grasped in sleep." We had paddled along the banks a distance
       of not less than thirty miles, every inch of which we had
       attentively examined, but not a bit of dry land could any
       where be discovered which was firm enough to bear our
       weight. Therefore, we resigned ourselves to circumstances,
       and all of us having been refreshed with a little cold rice
       and honey, and water from the stream, we permitted the canoe
       to drift down with the current, for our men were too much
       fatigued with the labours of the day to work any longer. But
       here a fresh evil arose which we were unprepared to meet. An
       incredible number of hippopotami arose very near us, and
       came plashing, snorting, and plunging all round the canoe,
       and placed us in imminent danger. Thinking to frighten them
       off, we fired a shot or two at them, but the noise only
       called up from the water and out of the fens, about as many
       more of their unwieldy companions, and we were more closely
       beset than before. Our people, who had never in all their
       lives been exposed in a canoe to such huge and formidable
       beasts, trembled with fear and apprehension, and absolutely
       wept aloud; and their terror was not a little increased by
       the dreadful peals of thunder which rattled over their
       heads, and by the awful darkness which prevailed, broken at
       intervals by flashes of lightning, whose powerful glare was
       truly awful. Our people told us, that these formidable
       animals frequently upset canoes in the river, when every one
       in them was sure to perish. These came so close to us, that
       we could reach them with the butt-end of a gun. When I fired
       at the first, which I must have hit, every one of them came
       to the surface of the water, and pursued us so fast over to
       the north bank, that it was with the greatest difficulty
       imaginable we could keep before them. Having fired a second
       time, the report of my gun was followed by a loud roaring
       noise, and we seemed to increase our distance from them.
       There were two Bornou men among our crew who were not so
       frightened as the rest, having seen some of these creatures
       before on Lake Tchad, where, they say, there are plenty of
       them. However, the terrible hippopotami did us no kind of
       mischief whatever; they were only sporting and wallowing in
       the river for their own amusement, no doubt, at first when
       we interrupted them; but had they upset our canoe, we should
       have paid dearly for it. We observed a bank on the north
       side of the river shortly after this, and I proposed halting
       on it for the night, for I wished much to put my foot on
       firm land again. This, however, not one of the crew would
       consent to, saying, that if the Gewo Roua, or water
       elephant, did not kill them, the crocodiles certainly would
       do so before the morning, and I thought afterwards that we
       might have been carried off like the Cumbrie people on the
       islands near Yaoorie, if we had tried the experiment. Our
       canoe was only large enough to hold us all when sitting, so
       that we had no chance of lying down. Had we been able to
       muster up thirty thousand cowries at Rabba, we might have
       purchased one which would have carried us all very
       comfortably. A canoe of this sort would have served us for
       living in entirely, we should have had no occasion to land
       excepting to obtain our provisions; and having performed our
       day's journey, might have anchored fearlessly at night.
       Finding we could not induce our people to land, we agreed to
       continue on all night. The eastern horizon became very dark,
       and the lightning more and more vivid; indeed, I never
       recollect having seen such strong fork lightning before in
       my life. All this denoted the approach of a storm. At eleven
       P.M. it blew somewhat stronger than a gale, and at midnight
       the storm was at its height. The wind was so strong, that it
       washed over the sides of the canoe several times, so that
       she was in danger of filling. Driven about by the wind, our
       frail little bark became unmanageable; but at length we got
       near a bank, which in some measure protected us, and we were
       fortunate enough to lay hold of a thorny tree against which
       we were driven, and which was growing nearly in the centre
       of the stream. Presently we fastened the canoe to its
       branches, and wrapping our cloaks round our persons, for we
       felt overpowered with fatigue, and with our legs projecting
       half over the sides of the little vessel, which, for want of
       room, we were compelled to do, we lay down to sleep. There
       is something, I believe, in the nature of a tempest which is
       favourable to slumber, at least so thought my brother; for
       though the thunder continued to roar, and the wind to
       blow,&mdash;though <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128"
       name="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span> the rain beat in our
       faces, and our canoe lay rocking like a cradle, still he
       slept soundly. The wind kept blowing hard from the eastward
       till midnight, when it became calm. The rain then descended
       in torrents, accompanied by thunder and lightning of the
       most awful description. We lay in our canoe drenched with
       water, and our little vessel was filling so fast, that two
       people were obliged to be constantly baling out the water to
       keep her afloat. The water-elephants, as the natives term
       the hippopotami, frequently came snorting near us, but
       fortunately did not touch our canoe. The storm continued
       until three in the morning of the 17th, when it became
       clear, and we saw the stars sparkling like gems over our
       heads. Therefore, we again proceeded on our journey down the
       river, there being sufficient light for us to see our way,
       and two hours after, we put into a small, insignificant,
       fishing village, called <i>Dacannie</i>, where we landed
       very gladly. Before we arrived at this island, we had passed
       a great many native towns and villages, but in consequence
       of the early hour at which we were travelling, we considered
       it would be imprudent to stop at any of them, as none of the
       natives were out of their huts. Had we landed earlier, even
       near one of these towns, we might have alarmed the
       inhabitants, and been taken for a party of robbers; or, as
       they are called in the country, <i>jacallees</i>. They would
       have taken up arms against us, and we might have lost our
       lives; so that for our safety we continued down the river,
       although we had great desire to go on shore. In the course
       of the day and night, we travelled, according to <i>our</i>
       estimation, a distance little short of a hundred miles. Our
       course was nearly east. The Niger in many places, and for a
       considerable way, presented a very magnificent appearance,
       and, we believe, to be nearly eight miles in
       width.&mdash;<i>Lit. Gaz.</i></p>

    <h2>The Gatherer.</h2>

    <p><i>Ancient Trade</i>.&mdash;Alexandria was formerly the
    chief commercial city in the world. We may judge of its wealth
    and prosperity by the circumstance, that, after the defeat of
    Queen Zenobia, a single merchant of this city, undertook to
    raise and pay an army out of the profits of his trade. Delos
    was the richest city in the Archipelago, it was a free port,
    where nations warring with each other, resorted with their
    goods, and traded. Strabo calls it one of the most frequented
    emporiums in the world; and Pliny tells us, that all the
    commodities of Europe and Asia were sold, purchased, or
    exchanged there. Trade was much encouraged at Athens; and if
    any one ridiculed it, he was liable to an action of slander. A
    fine of a thousand drachmas (about &pound;37. 10s.) was
    inflicted on him who accused a merchant of any crime which he
    was unable to prove. Solon was engaged in merchandize; the
    founder of the city of Messilia was a merchant; Thales and
    Hippocrates, the mathematician, traded; Plato sold oil in
    Egypt; Maximinus the Roman emperor, traded with the Goths in
    the produce of his estate in Thracia; Vespasian farmed the
    privies at Rome; and the Emperor Pertinax, originally dealt in
    charcoal.</p>

    <p><i>Unnecessary fears about the Cholera.</i>&mdash;Nothing is
    more calculated to allay unnecessay and groundless fear, in the
    case of the cholera, than the undeniable fact of the smallness
    of the mortality in proportion to the whole population, where
    it has raged with most violence. In addition to which, if it be
    borne in mind, that the disease invariably attacks those who
    are most predisposed to engender any malady, it is not
    unreasonable to infer, that of those to whom it has proved
    mortal, many would have died within the same period, had
    cholera not attacked them.&mdash;<i>Morning Herald.</i></p>

        1579, or in more modern periods. Within the recollection of

        mackerel, and in a propitious season, that species of fish
        has produced in Billingsgate market a sum of &pound;10,000,
        with which the town was enriched. In the autumn, 20 of
        these boats were fitted out for the herring voyage, and one
        boat has been known to land during the season from 20 to 30
        lasts of herrings, each last containing 10,000 fish,

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
